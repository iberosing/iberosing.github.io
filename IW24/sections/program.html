        We review Kontsevich's homological mirror symmetry conjecture and introduce the main players and different variants of the conjecture. This involves a discussion of the Fukaya category and about what it takes to relate this (a priori $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded) $A_\infty$-category to the derived category of coherent sheaves of a mirror complex manifold. We take a look at Seidel's proof for the quartic surface and genus two curve and Sheridan's proof for higher dimensional hypersurfaces. We also discuss the Fukaya-Seidel category for a Lefschetz fibration, Orlov's category of singularities and Abouzaid's homological mirror symmetry proof for Fano manifolds. We then develop an approach to prove homological mirror symmetry for general Calabi-Yau manifolds based on T-duality and skeleta. The T-duality here involves another conjecture known as the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture. The new part of this approach consists of ongoing work by Matessi, Mak, Zharkov and myself that provides a symplectic manifold with Lagrangian torus fibration over any given integral affine manifold with discriminant in codimension two that is well-behaved in a suitable sense.

        $D$-modules are modules over the sheaf of differential operators
        and over the years they found many applications in singularity theory.
        In these lectures I will discuss certain invariants of singularities (of
        hypersurfaces or, more generally, locally complete intersections)
        that can can be defined and studied using techniques from $D$-module theory
        (especially Saito's theory of Hodge modules), as well as certain classes of
        singularities characterized by these invariants, that refine the classical
        notions of rational and Du Bois singularities.

        Since Nash introduced them in 1968, arc spaces have proven to be rich objects when studying singularities of algebraic varieties. At that time, the Nash problem kept the attention of many mathematicians until it was finally solved by Fernández de Bobadilla and Pe Pereira. Arc spaces returned to the frontline of singularity theory in the 90's with the foundation of motivic integration by Denef and Loeser, for they served as the building blocks of the theory.
        </p>
        <p>
        Nonetheless, the possibilities of arcs do not end there, and they can also be used to study singularities of pairs $(X,D)$. In this new setting, the objects we have to look at are contact loci, i.e. subsets of arcs of $X$ with a prescribed intersection multiplicity with $D$. These subsets are essential to introduce the motivic zeta function, hence their importance in the monodromy conjecture. Moreover, classical singularity invariants such as the log canonical threshold or the minimal log discrepancy can also be expressed in terms of contact loci. Strikingly, in the last few years, a potential connection between contact loci and the symplectic properties of the Milnor fibration has been found.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this talk, I will review what is known about contact loci and their connection to singularity theory. In particular, I will address the first difficulty that arises when studying the geometry of contact loci, i.e. that they are highly non-irreducible. Determining its irreducible components geometrically is known as the embedded Nash problem, for its analogy to the classical Nash problem that pushed the development of arc spaces more than fifty years ago.

        Overtwisted contact structures in 3 dimensions were introduced by Y. Eliashberg in his seminal 1989 paper. One of their key properties is that two overtwisted contact structures are homotopic among contact structures if and only if they are homotopic among plane fields. However, the same is not true for the classification problem of families of overtwisted contact structures, up to homotopy: T. Vogel (2018) exhibited a non-contractible loop of overtwisted contact structures on the 3-sphere that is contractible as a loop of plane fields. In this talk, I will introduce a new subclass of overtwisted contact structures in dimension 3, called strongly overtwisted, for which the classification problem for families can indeed be reduced to the classification problem for families of plane fields.

        Legendrian knots in contact 3-manifolds form a richer family than classical knots, due to the fact that there exist several distinct Legendrian realizations of the same topological knot type. Despite significant progress over the last few decades, the complete classification of Legendrian knots remains a distant goal.
        </p>
        <p>
        A central question is how many distinct Legendrian realizations exist for a given knot type with prescribed classical invariants. If there is only one, we call the knot type Legendrian simple. Since the early 2000s, it has been known that Legendrian non-simple knot types exist. In 2019, using knot Floer homology and the contact invariant, we established lower bounds on the number of distinct realizations, identifying new examples of Legendrian non-simple knot types.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this talk, I will present an approach for establishing upper bounds as well. I will introduce the necessary concepts from convex surface theory, a powerful tool in contact topology, and explain how we can use these techniques to classify Legendrian knots with respect to Legendrian simplicity. As an application, I will present a joint result with Vera Vértesi, which provides an upper bound on the number of distinct Legendrian realizations of certain double twist knots with maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant.

        The lattice cohomology of isolated curve singularities was introduced by T. Ágoston and A. Némethi in 2023. It is an embedded topological invariant of plane curves and analytic in higher codimensions. Similarly to the topological lattice cohomology of surfaces which can be thought of as an analytic version of Heegard Floer homology, the lattice cohomology of plane curves is closely related to Heegard Floer Link homology.
        </p>
        <p>
        In this introductory talk, I will define the lattice cohomology of a curve singularity, show numerous examples, and compare it to various other classical invariants, such as the delta invariant, the Seifert form, or the multivariate Poincaré series. I will also outilne how it detects both the Gorenstein property and the multiplicity via the notion of local minima. Joint work with A. Némethi and G. Schefler.

        The analytic lattice cohomology of curve singularities has strong connection to other lattice cohomology theories and even Heegaard Floer Link theory. We will present how the weight function corresponding to irreducible plane curves can be computed, through a generalized Laufer sequence of universal cycles, from the weight function of the topological lattice cohomology corresponding to its minimal embedded resolution graph. This observation connects the embedded topology with the abstract analytic setup and also allows us to provide a new characterization of the  Apéry set of the abstract semigroup of values in more geometric terms. These results are joint with A. Kubasch and A. Némethi.
        </p>
        <p>
        The lattice cohomology of plane curve singularities is defined via valuations of the normalization. However, if the singularity is Newton nondegenerate, it is natural to use another set of valuations determined from the combinatorics of the Newton boundary. This provides a lattice cohomology with the same Euler characteristic, but with (usually) different weight functions. Our result with A. Némethi shows however, that the two lattice cohomologies agree. The methods allow us to extend the definition of the lattice cohomology to a more general algebraic setup, to certain ideals cut out by valuations having some special properties.

    <h4><q>3-braid knots with maximal 4-genus</q></h4>

        This talk deals with the problem of determining the topological 4-genus for the special case of 3-braid knots. The 4-genus of a knot is the minimal genus of a "nicely" embedded surface in the 4-dimensional ball with boundary the given knot. Asking whether a knot has 4-genus zero, i.e. whether it bounds a disk in the 4-ball, is a natural generalization in dimension 4 of the question whether it is isotopic to the trivial knot. It is one of the curiosities of low-dimensional topology that constructions such as finding these disks can sometimes be done in the topological category, but fail to work smoothly. The first examples of this phenomenon followed Freedman’s famous work on 4-manifolds.
        </p>
        <p>  
        Four decades later, the topological 4-genus of knots, even torus knots, remains difficult to determine. In a joint work with S. Baader, L. Lewark and F. Misev, we classify 3-braid knots whose topological 4-genus is maximal (i.e. equal to their 3-dimensional Seifert genus). In the talk, we will define the relevant terms and provide some context for our results.

        The trace operator plays a crucial role in the theory of partial differential equations, as it helps to find weak formulations of the problems. This theory, which is very satisfying on domains that have Lipschitz regular boundary,  is much more challenging when singularities arise. </p>
        <p>Our  aim is therefore to develop all the material necessary to find weak formulations of basic problems of PDE on a subanalytic or semi-algebraic open subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$, such as for instance elliptic differential  equations with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</p>
        <p>We will start by giving some Poincar\'e type inequalities for the functions of Sobolev spaces  of bounded subanalytic open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then we  will  investigate the trace operator on the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}(M)$, where $M$ is a bounded subanalytic submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$, in the case where $p$ is large.   This manifold $M$ may of course admit singularities in its closure which are not metrically conical.
